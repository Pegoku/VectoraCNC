## 11/5/2025 - Start planning and design  

For this CNC, I'll want something big-ish that fits on a desk. Want it to be able to cut wood, plastics and some soft metals, e.g. aluminum, even if it's at a slow speed.

This is the idea:
The dimensions I have in mind are: 300x200x5.
Bed made out of some t-nut compatible shape, so I can clamp parts. I'll probably make it out of 2x 20100 x 300mm
Network connectivity, preferably wired. (probably using CNCjs)
Only **1** PSU.

This is the BOM I have for now. Prob will change many things

Also, I started the CAD.
This is what I've got done for now.

## 11/7/2025 - Change plans  

Switching plans!
I found out about the 15180 aluminum extrusions (15x180) and they're cheaper, lighter and easier to use than 2x 20100 for the bed.
Also, I will probably go with linear rails, as they're stiffer than the linear shafts.

This is what I've got.
